~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Word processing in Coxeter groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With this class you can:

1. Build and visualize the automaton that recognizes the shortlex language of a Coxeter group.
2. Compute the normal form of a word (hence also the multiplication of two words).
3. Compute the set of minimal representatives of a standard parabolic subgroup.
4. Compute the coset table for a standard parabolic subgroup. For infinite Coxeter groups
   (i.e. affine and hyperbolic groups) the table is generated up to a given depth.

Important: always be aware of left and right cosets when computing coset representatives, in this
program we use the left convention: x for xH (assuming x = s₁s₂...sₙ is a shortlex word).
